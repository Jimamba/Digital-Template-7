<h2>Catch the patients</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A game where you must catch the patients falling the sky to get a score over a 100.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want my players to have fun, but find it difficult to get over 100 points, especially
later on when there are more patients falling from the sky.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Arcade-style, collection game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can move left or right using the arrow keys, and they must catch the patients falling from the sky.
The patients move at varying speeds depending on what happens when they get to the ground, i.e whether they're caught or not.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
A game that increases in difficulty the longer it goes. Unfortunately, if it goes on for
too long it becomes unbeatable.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The falling patients fall at varying speeds, and more are falling over time.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
For some reason hospital patients are falling from the sky, and you must catch a sufficient number of them to keep them safe.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
It doesn't really have a story.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Casual gamers.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Anywhere from 1 to 2 minutes if played efficiently, to forever if it gets to a certain point.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Focus on the spaces where you're able to save more people.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Music-> Soundcloud.
Sound effect -> Soundbible.
Everything else -> Hand-maid, or used from my previous templates.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Possibly my prototype 2.
